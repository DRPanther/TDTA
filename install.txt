Intallation Guide : Release name: The Dark Tower Adventures v0.06a

Prerequisites:
  Must be running Mystic, which make sense, as the program is an MPL. :)


Installation:
  Create the directory 'rcstdta' in your Mystic Sciripts directory (/mystic/scripts/rcstdta)
    This directory will contain all the data, ansi, etc, files. 

  Copy all files except rcstdta.mps tdtaconv.mps into this directory

  Copy the rcstdta.mps and tdtaconv.mps file into your Scripts directory

  Compile the MPS file:

    Windows:
      cd \mystic\scripts\
      mplc rcstdta
      mplc tdtaconv

    Linux:
      cd /mystic/scripts/
      ./mplc rcstdta
      ./mplc tdtaconv

  **IMPORTANT STEPS - DO NOT SKIP THESE STEPS***

  These steps will convert your player file over to the new format.
  If you are starting a new game, you can ignore this section.

  Copy the rcstdta.ply file into your Mystic directory.

  Run the conversion mpl with the following command line:
  mystic -uSysop_Name -ppassword -xtdtaconv

  You will see an output on the screen of the list of players.

  Once it has completed, you will have a file called newtdta.ply in your main Mystic directory

  Copy this file into the game directory, /mystic/scripts/rcstdta/

  Rename the newtdta.ply file to rcstdta.ply

  You have now convered your player database over to the new format.

  **You may now continue with the standard installation process** :)

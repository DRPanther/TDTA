1) Apparent God mode for NPC's:                                              
So I was looking following the beam and looking for things to fight, and     
after say 10 minutes of playing the game, everything I found that I could    
attack would not lose any health, yet I would lose health. Not sure how you  
algorithmised it, but I think something may have gone wobly as I attacked a  
can and each time I attacked it, it lost 0 health even though I hit it, and I
would lose health. I have had to run away from a can several times just to   
heal and quit, then reload the game to continue fighting =)                  

3) Not enough moves to play each day at any length...                          
So each day I have had this on my system, I log in and play it, and follow     
the beam and try and kill a bunch of stuff to raise funds, healing myself as   
and when I need to, this lasts about 5-7 minutes until I am out of moves, and  
then it kicks me out to the main town which means that all I can do now is     
fight a master, so I fight the master and instantly go up a level (due to my   
kick ass armour and weapon purchased with the above bonus/glitch).             
                                                                               
1) more shops, it's great to be able to spend your loot on weapons and        
armour, but it would also be cool to be able to buy other things, that may or 
may not be beneficial, like for example have a pie shop where you can buy     
food that can be consumed to raise health a little for each item eaten, a     
clothing shop that sells shoes/boots and hats etc, each item may increase or  
decrease your defense health a little, or maybe even a newsagents where you   
could by a newspaper that contains the news from another BBS that's connected 
to the InterBBS version of the game =)                                        

2) Items that can be joined to create other items of value, eg, you find a    
steel bracelet, you find another steel bracelet later, if you hold two        
steel bracelets together you can join them to create handcuffs, these         
handcuffs can be used to restrain NPC's to loot them without killing them, or 
perhaps you could find rings dotted about the realm, and once you collect 5   
rings you can wear all 5 on one hand to give you some extra power or skill,   
but if one ring gets knocked off in battle the gained skill/power is lost     
until you find the ring again.                                                
                                                                              
3) side missions, like perhaps you might come across a groany old man, who     
just wants to find a picture of his not too recently departed sister for       
example but he's mislaid it, and if you help him find it you gain something    
for your trouble, that perhaps would be useful or even necessary to defeat a   
later master, perhaps some knowledge of a way to defeat a master more easily.
